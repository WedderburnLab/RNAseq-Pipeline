This project explains the pipeline that the Wedderburn lab used to process bulk RNAseq data using UCL HPC.

Part 1: HPC run
- notes about how to run the pipeline using HPC
- in UCL, Myriad is the name of the HPC

Part 2: Read counts generation
- all codes regarding running the pipeline to extract read counts from FASTQ files
- QC was conducted and report can be requested

RNAseq pipeline was created by Wei-Yu Lin on March 16, 2021
The pipeline was created to process all FASTQ files generated by the Wedderburn lab from UCL Genomics
The whole pipeline is hosted in
